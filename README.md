## Download

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Bishop-R/midi-to-bdo/releases) page and download:

- **Windows**: `MIDI.to.BDO.exe`
- **Linux**: `MIDI.to.BDO`

No installation or Python required — just run the executable.

## Usage

1. Run the executable
2. Click **Browse** and select a MIDI file
3. Assign BDO instruments to each detected MIDI channel
4. Adjust settings (transpose, velocity, BPM override, etc.) as needed
5. Click **Convert**
6. The output file appears in a `converted/` folder next to the executable

### Owner ID (edit access)

To edit your composition in-game, you need to embed your account's owner ID:

1. Save any composition in BDO's music composer (even a blank one)
2. In the converter, click **Load ID from BDO file** and select that saved file
3. Your character name and owner ID will be loaded automatically

BDO music files are stored in:
`Documents/Black Desert/GameOption/musicrecord/`
